  Meta-analysis (MA) is a statistical method that involves combining information from multiple studies. Initially, meta-analyses were limited in aggregated data (AD), until the early 1990s when individual participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) was introduced [@CHALMERS_1993]. In IPD-MA the participant level information is available and therefore the whole data-set can be analysed as a whole. IPD-MA is considered the gold standard in evidence synthesis and offers great rewards [@van_Walraven_2010]. The most obvious reward is the increased power due to the increased number of observations. This is essential when our meta-analysis consists of randomised clinical trials (RCTs). RCTs are designed to have power to barely investigate an overall treatment effect. Nevertheless, the one treatment fits all may not be true. Different patients characteristics may alter the effect of a treatment. These chracteristics are often called effect modifiers and their investigation can lead to better clinical decision-making, whether to treat or not a patient. In single studies a potential effect modifier can be detected by either including interaction terms or by measuring the treatment effect over the levels of the modifier. Apparently, the second choice may be performed only with categorical effect modifiers. In that case both approaches coincide. That is not true in IPD-MA, where it is essential to account for within studies clustering of the participants [@Riley_2010]. If we pool the across trials estimates per-subgroup and then compare them, we will not end up to the same result as pooling the per trial interaction terms [@Fisher_2011]. Additionally, continuous effect modifiers can be even more challenging. The functional shape of their association with the outcome may be more complicated than a straight line. One approach is to neglect that fact and either categorise the continous co-variable or make linearity assuptions. Nevertheless, both approaches have been critisized. Finally, IPD-MA may be conducted either in one or two stages [@Debray_2015]. In two-stage IPD-MA, each study is first analysed separately, using an appropriate statistical model. Subsequently, the results extracted in the first stage are pooled into a summary estimate in the second stage of the meta-analysis. In the other hand, one-stage IPD-MA can be conducted with mixed effects model adjusting for within trial clustering. 
  Our goal is perform a scoping review on IPD-MAs and report whether 1) they have investigated effect modification 2) which method was performed 3) whether the effect modifier was categorical or continuous and 4) which modeling assumptions were made. Since IPD-MA is a challenging     in the Cochrane library and report if they investigated for effect modification over patient level characteristics. We chose the Cochrane library as Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses are considered on average of high quality. 

  
  
# Methods 
We searched in the Cochrane library for IPD meta-analyses (https://methods.cochrane.org/ipdma/ipd-meta-analyses). The cochrane library for IPD-MA is divided into 18 medical fields. Specifically, more than 200 articles involving  
Cochrane library contains numerous systematic reviews and meta-analyses covering various medical fields.
