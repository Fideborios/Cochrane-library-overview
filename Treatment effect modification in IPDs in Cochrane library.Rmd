  Meta-analysis (MA) is a statistical method that involves combining information from multiple studies. Initially, meta-analyses were limited in aggregated data (AD), until the early 1990s when individual participant data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) was introduced [@CHALMERS_1993]. In IPD-MA the participant level information is available and therefore the whole data-set can be analysed as a whole. IPD-MA is considered the gold standard in evidence synthesis and offers great rewards [@van_Walraven_2010]. The most obvious reward is the increased power due to the increased number of observations. This is essential when our meta-analysis consists of randomised clinical trials (RCTs). RCTs are designed to have power to barely investigate an overall treatment effect. Nevertheless, the one treatment fits all may not be true. Different patients characteristics may alter the effect of a treatment. These characteristics are often called effect modifiers and their investigation can lead to better clinical decision-making, whether to treat or not a patient. In single studies a potential effect modifier can be detected by either including interaction terms or by measuring the treatment effect over the levels of the modifier. Apparently, the second choice may be performed only with categorical effect modifiers. In that case both approaches coincide. That is not true in IPD-MA, where it is essential to account for within studies clustering of the participants [@Riley_2010]. If we pool the across trials estimates per-subgroup and then compare them, we will not end up to the same result as pooling the per trial interaction terms [@Fisher_2011]. Additionally, continuous effect modifiers can be even more challenging. The functional shape of their association with the outcome may be more complicated than a straight line. One approach is to neglect that fact and either categorise the continuous co-variable or make linearity assumptions. Nevertheless, both approaches have been criticized. Finally, IPD-MA may be conducted either in one or two stages [@Debray_2015]. In two-stage IPD-MA, each study is first analysed separately, using an appropriate statistical model. Subsequently, the results extracted in the first stage are pooled into a summary estimate in the second stage of the meta-analysis. In the other hand, one-stage IPD-MA can be conducted with mixed effects model adjusting for within trial clustering. 
  Our goal is perform a scoping review on IPD-MAs and report whether 1) they have investigated effect modification 2) which method was performed 3) whether the effect modifier was categorical or continuous and 4) which modelling assumptions were made. Since IPD-MA is a challenging     in the Cochrane library and report if they investigated for effect modification over patient level characteristics. We chose the Cochrane library as Cochrane reviews and meta-analyses are considered on average of high quality. 

  
  
# Methods 

We investigated how effect modification has been conducted in studies with multiple trials included and with individual participant data available. Since numerous IPD-MAs are conducted worlwide we narrowed our search into cochrane 

We searched in the Cochrane library for IPD meta-analyses (https://methods.cochrane.org/ipdma/ipd-meta-analyses). The cochrane library for IPD-MA is divided into 18 medical fields (Cancer, Cardiovascular disease, Child health, Ear nose and throat, Endocrine and metabolic, Eyes and vision, Gastroenterology, Gynaecology, Infectious disease, Lungs and airways, Mental health, Multiple clinical areas, Neonatal care, Neurology, Pregnancy and childbirth, Renal disease, Rheumatology, Wounds). In total 203 studies are reported from 1991 to 2018. Almost half of them (96) were investigating some type of cancer(47.25%). 34 studies were over cardiovascular diseases, 16 over Neurology and 10 over Pregnancy and childbirth. All other medical fields had less than 10. Particularly, 1 was over Child health, 5 Ear nose and throat, 1 Endocrine and metabolic, 2 Eyes and vision,5 Gastroenterology, 5 Gynaecology, 3 Infectious disease, 1 Lungs and airways, 9 Mental health, 1 Multiple clinical areas, 3 Neonatal care, 6 Renal disease, 2 Rheumatology, 2 Wounds. Out of the 201 studies we excluded 11 as they were ongoing and no-results were showed and 26 studies from the Cardiovascular category, as 10 were investigating risk factors and 16 prevention methods. 

  Cancer related studies were further divided into 14 categories depending on the infected organ, see Figure 1.
