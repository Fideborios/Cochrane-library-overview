  Meta-analysis is a statistical method that involves combining results from multiple studies. Initially, meta-analysis were the final part of a systematic review and were conducted almost exclusively in aggregated data. In the early 1990s individual participant data meta-analysis (IPDMA) was introduced. In IPD-MA the participant level data from various studies are available and analysed centrally. Numerous rewards and challenges [@van_Walraven_2010] place IPD-MA to the top of data analysis and is widely considered the gold standard of evidence synthesis offering. One of the most profound uses of IPD-MA is the investigation of treatment effect differences across patients with different characteristics. Numerous approaches have been proposed and extensive literature exists over which methods shoudl be prefered, when investigating effect modification.
  Briefly, the methods that are mostly used are one-stage IPD-MA involving multi-level (or mixed-effects) models, two-stage meta-analysis of interaction terms, per-subgroup meta-analysis and meta-regression [@Fisher_2011].
